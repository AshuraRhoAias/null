## PARTE 1: PERFIL PROFESIONAL (5 MINUTOS)

### SLIDE 1: PORTADA
**[Texto a leer]**

Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Rebeca Pérez-Flores, and I'm a Research Assistant on the TELAR project at MESA México, based at the Institute for Social Research at UNAM in Mexico City.

Thank you for this opportunity to share our work with the TABLE community today.

### SLIDE 2: ¿QUIÉN SOY?

**[Texto a leer]**

My academic background is quite interdisciplinary. I hold a degree in Pharmaceutical Biological Chemistry from UNAM's Faculty of Chemistry, which gave me a strong foundation in the exact sciences.

However, my interests led me to explore the intersection of science, ethics, and society. I pursued specialized diplomas in Bioethics with an emphasis on animal ethics from UNAM's Bioethics Program and Mexico's National Bioethics Commission. I also completed diplomas in Environment and Sustainable Development, and Environmental Education from Universidad Iberoamericana.

This interdisciplinary training—combining chemistry, bioethics, and environmental sciences—shapes how I approach complex food systems challenges.

### SLIDE 3: MI INVESTIGACIÓN - CARNISMO E IDENTIDAD MEXICANA

**[Texto a leer]**

My research centers on the intersection of animal ethics and food systems in the Mexican context.

Specifically, I explore how carnism—the invisible ideology that conditions us to eat certain animals—influences the establishment of Mexican cultural identity through traditional cuisine. I investigate the role of advertising in maintaining this ideology, and how food becomes a vehicle for cultural identity construction.

I've also conducted practical field research on animal welfare in federal and municipal slaughterhouses across three of Mexico's main meat-producing states, documenting conditions and welfare practices on the ground.

This combination of cultural analysis and field research gives me a unique perspective on the complexities of transitioning to more sustainable and ethical food systems in Mexico.

---

### SLIDE 4: MI ROL EN TELAR

**[Texto a leer]**

In the TELAR project, I work on exploring the future of industrial livestock farming and the potential for transition towards more sustainable and ethical food systems in Mexico.

This is a binational collaboration between MESA México and MESA Colombia, and we're applying TABLE's innovative methodology to the Latin American context—adapting participatory foresight tools to our specific territorial conflicts, cultural complexities, and institutional challenges.

Now, let me share what we've been doing on the ground in Mexico.

## PARTE 2: AVANCES PROYECTO TELAR (10 MINUTOS)

### SLIDE 5: CONTEXTO - INVESTIGACIÓN INICIAL SECTOR GANADERO

**[Texto a leer]**

Our initial research focused on Mexico's livestock sector broadly, examining both cattle and pork production systems.

We quickly discovered something critical: these two systems are substantially different.

They differ in levels of technological intensification, in the distribution and size of producers, in their environmental footprints, and in their social impacts.

Most importantly, we identified severe territorial conflicts in the pork sector—specifically between industrial mega-farms and Maya communities in the Yucatán Peninsula.

Given the urgency and complexity of these conflicts, we decided to address each sector separately, prioritizing the pork sector for our initial sounding tables.

---

### SLIDE 6: MAPA DE ACTORES CLAVE (MAC)

**[Texto a leer]**

This research allowed us to develop a Key Actors Map identifying 35 actors across 4 levels:

- Primary producers and industry
- Government and regulatory bodies
- Civil society organizations and academia
- Affected communities

This mapping was essential to understand who needed to be in the room for meaningful dialogue.

---

### SLIDE 7: INNOVACIÓN - MAPA DE TENSIONES

**[Texto a leer]**

But we went further. MESA México developed an innovative methodological contribution: the Tensions Map.

This tool allowed us to identify 69 specific tensions between actors in the pork production system.

These weren't abstract conflicts—they were concrete tensions around water contamination, land use rights, animal welfare standards, export policies, and community health impacts.

The Tensions Map became fundamental for understanding why simple multi-stakeholder dialogue wasn't going to work. The conflicts were too deep, the power asymmetries too significant.

This led us to design two separate Sounding Tables.

---

### SLIDE 8: DISEÑO - DOS MESAS SEPARADAS

**[Texto a leer]**

We designed two separate Sounding Tables to be held in Mérida, Yucatán on November 13-14, 2024, at the facilities of CEPHCIS—the Peninsula Center for Humanities and Social Sciences.

**Table A: "Alternative and Transformative Perspectives on the Pork Sector: Possible Futures"**
We invited environmental and animal rights CSOs, academics, Maya communities, and government actors at the communities' request.

**Table B: "Development and Competitiveness of Mexico's Pork Sector: Possible Futures"**
We invited industry actors and government representatives.

The idea was to create safe spaces for each perspective to explore values, evidence, and visions freely—before bringing everyone together in a future multi-stakeholder dialogue table.

---

### SLIDE 9: DESAFÍO - PROCESO DE INVITACIONES

**[Texto a leer]**

The invitation process was extremely complex.

Since we didn't know these actors personally—a conclusion we reached after the event—it was particularly difficult to get Maya communities to accept participation. There was deep distrust.

For industry actors, their traditional communication channels were completely closed. We couldn't even get responses to emails or phone calls.

Additionally, we realized many actors couldn't travel to Mérida for in-person participation, so we enabled virtual participation.

We designed a series of 5 dynamics to explore values, perspectives, and future visions according to TABLE methodology. We also developed an informed consent process to ensure security and confidentiality for participants.

However, we discovered that our informed consent verification system for virtual participants was too bureaucratic, which affected participation from many confirmed attendees. This was an important methodological lesson.

---

### SLIDE 10: DINÁMICA CLAVE - VISIONES DE FUTURO

**[Texto a leer]**

Let me highlight one particularly powerful dynamic we designed.

To explore future visions, we conducted a guided visualization so participants could connect emotionally—not just rationally—with future scenarios.

After the visualization, we asked them to write what they had envisioned on colored cards:
- **Green** if they saw a better future
- **Yellow** if they saw things staying the same
- **Red** if they saw a worse future

We then presented them with 4 specific future scenarios and asked them to select which they considered **viable** (possible), and which they considered **desirable** (what they wanted).

This allowed us to explore the gap between what people think is possible and what they actually want—and to identify what factors might bridge that gap.

---

### SLIDE 11: MESA A - ASISTENCIA Y COMPOSICIÓN

**[Texto a leer]**

On November 13th, Table A had strong participation:
- **11 in-person attendees**
- **12 virtual participants**

The composition was predominantly animal rights CSOs and environmental organizations.

Critically, we had only one Maya community represented—Santa María Chi—through community representative Wilberth Nahuat.

No government actors attended, despite invitations and confirmations.

---

### SLIDE 12: MESA A - MOMENTO DE TENSIÓN REVELADOR

**[Texto a leer]**

The event was very engaging, though at one point during the dynamics there was a moment of tension.

An academic who favors the industry debated with an activist about the industry's permanence, arguing that a novel wastewater treatment methodology could resolve environmental conflicts.

This revealed something important: there was **indirect representation of industry perspectives** at Table A, even without formal industry presence.

Interestingly, other actors applauded this tension. They considered it positive and powerful that this academic was there to hear the narratives of other actors—the majority of whom supported a complete transition from animal-based production systems to plant-based systems.

---

### SLIDE 13: MESA A - VOCES DISIDENTES

**[Texto a leer]**

However, not all voices were abolitionist.

One participant questioned industrialization itself—whether animal or plant-based—proposing small-scale, local systems like the traditional Milpa instead.

This complexity was valuable. It showed that even within the "alternative perspectives" group, there were significant differences in vision.

---

### SLIDE 14: MESA A - RESULTADOS MENTIMETER

**[Texto a leer]**

Our Mentimeter results from Table A revealed clear patterns:

In the word cloud opening activity, the dominant words were:
- **Oppression**
- **Cruelty**
- **Violence**
- **Contamination**

On the dilemma of "Jobs vs. Water/Environment":
- 57% favored closing operations with support for alternative employment
- 0% prioritized jobs over water

On the question of production scales and certifications:
- 92% favored transition toward systems without animal exploitation

On territorial rights vs. jobs:
- 100% prioritized territorial rights and community health

This confirmed that Table A captured critical/transformative perspectives successfully.

---

### SLIDE 15: MESA A - TARJETAS VERDES

**[Texto a leer]**

It was hopeful to see that in the colored cards dynamic, there was a **majority of green cards**—meaning positive future visions despite current conflicts.

Despite ongoing territorial conflicts, contamination, animal exploitation, and government approval of new mega-farms even while others are being shut down, participants still envisioned better futures as possible.

Final comments from Table A participants were mostly positive and centered on the value of incorporating the dimension of animal ethics into the complexity of pork production systems.

In the final dynamic, we asked them to note priority themes they wanted to continue addressing and which actors were necessary.

The vast majority expressed interest in participating in a third Dialogue Table where actors from both Table A and Table B would come together.

---

### SLIDE 16: MESA B - CRISIS DE CONVOCATORIA

**[Texto a leer]**

For Table B, we had very few confirmed participants.

As a last resort, I went in person to the corporate offices of **Kekén**—Mexico's largest pork production group—where I was received by the Head of Communications.

I explained my background, the project's objectives, and the exploratory focus. I showed him the workbook designed for virtual participation.

He showed interest in having it applied personally via videoconference with the Head of Sustainability—who was the actor we had considered key for the table.

He confessed that **all their communication channels are closed due to attacks they've been subjected to**. If I hadn't gone in person, we would never have made contact.

He said it was impossible for them to attend that day, but they were waiting for my message to schedule a guided interview using the virtual workbook with Kekén's Head of Sustainability.

---

### SLIDE 17: MESA B - FRACASO Y APRENDIZAJE

**[Texto a leer]**

Table B was held on November 14th with only **3 in-person attendees**, two of whom had already attended Table A.

The new actor was from **SEMARNAT**—Mexico's Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources.

We modified the dynamics to become an open dialogue, which was actually very enriching.

The productive/industry vision and perspectives were clearly manifested.

At one point, communities were even accused of **contaminating on purpose to file complaints**, damaging the environment themselves.

We concluded that legislation is insufficient without people's will, and that environmental programs should be maintained rather than being subject to the political administration in power.

---

### SLIDE 18: LECCIÓN CLAVE - CONSTRUCCIÓN DE CONFIANZA

**[Texto a leer]**

Although Table B was a failure in terms of turnout, we obtained strategic contacts that will allow a new approach using the same methodology: guided virtual interviews using the workbook.

This experience taught us critical lessons:

**It's essential to contact people in person** to establish trust and empathy for them to accept participation—both for communities and for industry.

CSOs and academia are more accustomed to invitations to similar events, though TABLE's methodology focus is unique.

We also learned that **processes must be simple**, with complete documentation from the start and time for participants to decide whether to attend based on the dynamics.

---

### SLIDE 19: REFLEXIÓN METODOLÓGICA

**[Texto a leer]**

The exploration of values, evidence, perspectives, and future visions—which involve people, not just hard data—depends on **interpersonal relationships** established to generate a safe environment of trust that allows people to express themselves.

This is particularly true in contexts of deep conflict, power asymmetries, and historical distrust like we're facing in Yucatán.

Methodology matters, but relationship-building matters more.

---

### SLIDE 20: ESTADO ACTUAL - SISTEMATIZACIÓN

**[Texto a leer]**

We are currently systematizing the information obtained from both tables.

We've processed:
- Complete Mentimeter results from Table A
- 5 completed workbooks from virtual participants
- Notes from in-person discussions
- The testimony from Wilberth Nahuat from Santa María Chi community—including critical data like 5 deaths from kidney disease in his community, and the expansion from 700 to 49,000 pigs

We're conducting comparative analysis of the perspectives to understand:
- Where convergences exist
- Where tensions are irreconcilable
- What neutral evidence is needed
- What themes must be addressed in multi-stakeholder dialogue

---

### SLIDE 21: PRÓXIMOS PASOS - CONSULTAS GUIADAS

**[Texto a leer]**

We're now conducting **guided individual consultations** with industry and government actors who couldn't participate in the tables.

These interviews use an adapted version of the virtual participant workbook, exploring:
- Dilemmas on jobs vs. environment
- Certifications and production scales
- Territorial rights
- Environmental regulations
- Future visions for the pork sector

This approach allows us to:
- Capture absent perspectives without confrontation
- Build trust gradually with industry actors
- Generate comparable data across all actor groups
- Prepare the ground for future multi-stakeholder dialogue

---

### SLIDE 22: FUTURO - MESA MULTI-STAKEHOLDER

**[Texto a leer]**

Soon, we plan to organize a virtual **Multi-stakeholder Dialogue Table** convening actors from both tables.

We'll share the main findings with all participants beforehand.

We'll continue building proposals and pathways for action together.

The goal is not consensus—but rather **informed understanding** of different perspectives, **identification of possible bridges**, and **construction of concrete next steps** that respect the complexity of this territorial conflict.

---
